		<strong>Meet the Business Owner</strong>
		</br></br>
			I am a veteran of the United States Army. Born and raised on the island of Oahu. My brother Keone Laepa'a from Prodiver Maui helped me with my dream of building me a food truck that allowed me to serve both traditional local Hawaiian and Soul food. My husband and I work hard to offer courteous and prompt service the aloha way.

			Business Owner</strong>
		</br></br>
			As a native Hawaiian from Oahu and former veteran of the US Army stationed at Fort Bragg, NC. I was able to bring what I know from childhood and learned from the south to create a unique menu for all people. My husband and I blend well in that we can offer a great and tasty selection of unique food that is not offered anywhere around Delaware. We have brought the 50th state to the 1st state. Mahalo for welcoming our Ohana.</p>
